Collects and displays data related to physics objects in the scene. It monitors performance metrics of physics interactions and helps optimize physical simulations.

### Audio Clips Profiler

Analyzes and profiles audio clips used in the scene. Provides detailed information on audio clip properties and usage statistics.

### Particle Systems Profiler

Gathers data on particle systems, offering insights into their performance and impact on the scene. Helps in optimizing particle effects for better performance.

### Lights Profiler

Collects and presents data on all light sources within the scene. Provides metrics to optimize lighting for improved performance and visual quality.

### Materials Profiler

Profiles materials used in the scene, displaying detailed information on material properties and usage. Aids in optimizing material configurations for better rendering performance.

### Meshes Profiler

Collects data on meshes within the scene. Offers insights into mesh properties and their impact on performance.

### Textures Profiler

Analyzes textures used in the scene, providing detailed information on texture properties and usage. Helps in optimizing texture usage for improved performance.

### Warnings Data Collector

Collects and displays warnings related to various aspects of the scene. Helps in identifying and addressing potential issues that may affect performance.

### Missing Assets Profiler

Identifies and reports missing assets within the scene. Ensures that all necessary assets are present and properly referenced.

## Usage

1. Open the Scene Profiler Tool window from the Unity menu: `Window > Analysis > Scene Profiler`.
2. Select the profiling category you want to analyze (e.g., Physics, Audio Clips, Particle Systems, etc.).
